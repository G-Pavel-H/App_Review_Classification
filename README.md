# App Review Classification

This project is focused on classifying app reviews to enhance the requirements engineering process. The classification includes categories such as bug reports, feature requests, user experience comments, and ratings. The objective is to leverage advanced language models to improve the efficiency and accuracy of analyzing app reviews.

## Project Overview

App review classification is critical for understanding user feedback and improving app functionality. This project uses various pretrained language models to categorize app reviews, providing valuable insights for developers. The models implemented include RoBERTa, ELECTRA, ERNIE, and BART, each offering unique advantages in processing and classifying textual data.

## Models Used

1. **RoBERTa (Robustly optimized BERT approach):**
   - **Overview:** An enhanced version of BERT that uses dynamic masking and removes the next sentence prediction task, leading to improved performance on various NLP tasks.
   - **Strength:** Achieves superior performance by leveraging larger datasets and longer training periods.

2. **ELECTRA (Efficiently Learning an Encoder that Classifies Token Replacements Accurately):**
   - **Overview:** Utilizes a generator-discriminator framework to distinguish between real and fake tokens, offering more efficient training compared to traditional models.
   - **Strength:** Provides faster training and effective use of data, making it ideal for scenarios with limited computational resources.

3. **ERNIE (Enhanced Representation through kNowledge Integration):**
   - **Overview:** Integrates structured knowledge from external sources to enhance the model’s understanding of language and semantic relationships.
   - **Strength:** Enhances comprehension of entity relationships and factual knowledge, improving performance on tasks requiring deep language understanding.

4. **BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers):**
   - **Overview:** Combines bidirectional encoding and autoregressive decoding to handle both text understanding and generation tasks efficiently.
   - **Strength:** Flexible and powerful, excelling in tasks that require both comprehension and text generation.

## Key Points

- **Pretrained Language Models:** The project explores the use of state-of-the-art language models to categorize app reviews accurately.
- **Focus on Efficiency:** Models like ELECTRA and ERNIE are selected for their ability to provide efficient and effective processing, essential for handling large datasets.
- **Comprehensive Analysis:** Each model’s performance is evaluated across different scenarios, ensuring robust and reliable classification of app reviews.

## Project Highlights

- **Innovative Approaches:** Uses advanced techniques in NLP to handle complex classification tasks.
- **Real-World Impact:** Aims to provide practical solutions for app developers to better understand user feedback and enhance app development processes.
