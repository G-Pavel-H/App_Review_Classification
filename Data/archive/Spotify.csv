b682dd76-b33f-46a2-856e-c5aebd8900a6,Its time to switch from spotify to Amazon prime music now. From past 1-2 weeks Spotify has made all basic features as premium feature. Can't play song what I want in my playlist. Can't add songs in queue. Can't forward or backward the song. Can't play the previous or next track in my playlist. All this basic features if someone wants to use. Then it is compulsory to update to premium. Why prime music for me. Spotify is only known for Music app and prime is for multiple use case.,1

57609748-45dc-4f4c-b98b-7a459e4256d3,I must say it is definitely a good app. There may seem some rather annoying features of not having premium on this app such as the adds to each next song.,2
aae41cab-493f-4002-b151-3603c93dbb3f,Worst app ever made asks premium for everything in the app even we can't play previous song as well as we can't add song to the playlist,1

0da15db6-ab5b-482a-aa81-0756d4f5181b,I have been using Spotify for over a year now but the updates just keep getting worse. First it won't let me search up songs in my playlist anymore which is very annoying every 3 songs there's an add. Also it's not even a good experience for people who don't have premium. It won't let me in un shuffle songs. Also if I want to restart a song it won't let me. Please limit your options for premium I can't use the app without a notification to get premium over the smallest things please fix.,2

Why you guys are making everything just for money. Are you even that poor? It's not even like i am listening Spotify every minute. Guys its better to go back to that time where we download songs and listen without any disturbance. And good luck with the new rating Spotiuglify.,1

This version does not has the basic options which makes this app the worst music app. Like seriously who removes previous song button and other basic features from a music app . Now I cannot even play a particular part of any song and always have to wait for it . This version is really disappointing. Please fix the app .,1

Get it restored to what it used to be earlier or else your platform will sink to bankruptcy quite soon.,1

4a3a8bf5-c843-44d7-b723-f96feaed3040,I've been a fan of Spotify since the beginning. The whole idea of people having to freedom to listen to artists not spoon-fed to them by the gate keepers (Big labels). Unfortunately it looks like Spotify is bowing down to the big money men of the music business. Its looking like they are going to be taking the money away from Micro-Artists (people that don't meet their minimum threshold of streams). and giving almost all of it to people like Drake or whoever the major labels are promoting.,1
c6802844-61ab-419c-ba76-f5caa6a97d9c,Why did Spotify removed more than half music's lyrics? But when My Internet wasn't working good Spotify works easy and that what I like the most about Spotify.

You can install wynk music or other app for free background playing music app with app. If if you think for subscription plan then go towards YT Music which is much better and low cost(99 rupees mountly where Spotify is 119 in this price you can get whole YouTube premium at 129 only ) . In YT Music you can get much features than this . You ca try any other app like gana whose subscription fees very low (below 300 with offer now yearly) price. Try others app,1

But due to new changes made in this app I am unable to listen the music I want to. It's getting too difficult to be in my comfort zone when such irritating and useless changes are made. I request to delete all the new changes made and give the users a chanceto listen to their favourite songs independently. I am a big spotify user. Thank you.,1

1f4505a7-3f96-4539-ab82-a0f8e9805c08,I used to address it as the best listening platform but since the new update launched it has basically cut all the features and functions which is the general motive of this application. This discrimination is on the next level soon they'll ask for a premium subscription for simply listening to a music. 6 SKIPS PER HOUR?? AND THEY CANT EVEN PLAY A SPECIFIC PAET OF THAT SONG I HATE THIS SHUFFLING THING. They are now just begging. I can spend my money on everything but Spotify premium subscription,1

1721b44c-754d-42ae-bb1d-bdbc8e8560ee,"The app and service is okay but nothing to shout out about, at least compared to YouTube Music. One feature that is crucially missing is being able to scroll through the current playlist and select a previous item. Yeah, I can keep hitting previous song but that takes forever. Chromecasting is not as fluid and consistent as Google's own services. Not quite sure why Spotify has a hold on this market when it clearly is lagging behind in certain areas.",3
cf7a8948-a95e-4dcd-9d8b-0ca92f9547b5,"Why does listening to MY playlist is a premium option now? And why is going back to a song is premium, looping playlist or song is premium ? Spotify u already had so many ads and now you are doing this, I am DISSAPOINTED",1

Where you can set your alarm clock in Spotify so it'll play one of your own playlist and stuff! I know it's already possible (I think) to set a Spotify song as your alarm tune on some devices but not on all of them. That would be so cool :) Have a nice day!,5

I agree. But this is just too much. You can't skip more than 6 times. You can't choose songs of your own after a particular time. You HAVE to listen to what Spotify plays for you even if you don't want to listen to that particular song. And ads are always there. I hope that they don't force us this much at least.,3

Unless you have a set playlist which I choose not to make. It's ridiculous. I don't understand why they can't make it more of a simplistic app,1

da71db29-35b0-4bc6-8e39-248ebca64cfc,After the last update this app has become the worst ever app in the music apps field as to even use the basic features we have to give money . What happened Spotify did you become poor or just wanted more money. If playatore had the option to rate 0 then I would rate it 0 from almost 100 accounts. But before it was so good that whenever someone considered me another app for playing music I said to them that Spotify is the best app but now I am reconsidering the apps my friends told me to use.,1

164f31ab-e380-4c24-98cc-a56866019e7d,"Not happy with the new update. Smart shuffle is a pain in the az. You cannot select a song to play, you cannot shuffle, you cannot choose what part of the song you want to listen to.. so basically we can just browse albums and create playlists.. plus ads are mandatory and after listening to those patiently I cannot even select what I want to listen to?",1

f6607388-7954-4863-b548-c1ba56e47aa4,Worst app ever seen its all basic features are now in premium mode after update. Never thought spotify can even do this. We love spotify it doesn't mean you'll play with our love to Spotify I request to change Spotify to default as before so that everyone can enjoy its basics without premium. It's my humble request to you please make it as before as it was🙏🏻 I hope Spotify would understand and take action against this🙏🏻 THANKYOU,2

Free user are like annoyed with this and are not liking with the new update norms and condition. I have not access to shuffle my list nor I can go back to my playlist to previous song. This is totally ridiculous, if this continuous... People have other options out there which people will make them popular apart from Spotify.",1
