And there is no option for 1080HD with 1 screen and no ads. IMO that shouldn't be more than 10/mo. THEYVE GOTTEN WAY TOO EXPENSIVE!! it's cheaper to just rent or buy the few movies I wanna watch.

e204d928-75d3-4471-99cd-6e23bbb8fe74,"Granted its way cheaper than cable but Netflix used to have all the newest movies and most shows. Now all we get is blockbuster flops with one or two hits occasionally and for most shows I have to wait up to a year for new episodes. It's great for finding something to put on for doing Homework or killing time but the selection could be better, but I know it's because of contact deals and what not that prevent them from it.  I'll definitely take it over cable though",1

e7c52152-ca67-4029-9f3f-3c693025e2c2,Netflix is seriously tanking lately. Bummer. Seems like a bunch of money grubbers but without actual creative vision. The shows are lacking in quality and they're chasing the good people out while simultaneously jacking up prices and now this geo location thing? Half the reason this app was good was so you could give it to a friend. But nah. Just a bunch of money grubbing without any love for the craft. Sad. Truly sad.,2

Would love to see season 2 for ""Sanctuary"" sumo series but like most other series it will never get season 2. I would watch other titles I may like but their subtitled.

Simply put, every so often, the Netflix app decides that my phone (Samsung S22 Ultra EXYNOS) no longer supports Widevine L1 and reverts to L3, which limits my video playback to SD at a horrible bitrate despite having a 4K plan. They have known about this for well over a year with this phone and they have had plenty of time to fix it. When I get the issue the only fix is to clear the app's data and cache, then restart my phone.",2

A person can have on their account when the shows aren't even that great anymore. And anything that is you only get to watch one. Episode per week like cable when it used to be. They Uploaded full seasons at a time and had better titles. Higher price lower quality bad business And they wonder why people won't buy their own account,1

You guys dont make good shows and if you do you cancel them instantly because of not enough views maybe if you add a second season and then it doesnt get views then you can stop production on the show. Example: Lockwood and Co it has a great beggining but at the end there are so many mysteries and possibilities with the show if you added a second season i think it would get enough views. Please consider,3

(Working with VLC would be nice but I'm not going to hold my breath) My only other complaint is I wish there were more TV shows pacifically from the 90s and early 2000s and so on. It's nice that you're making your own content Netflix but don't stop buying license for other content. p.s. the app runs good,3

It is also a huge pain if you are traveling and try to log in, you have to get security codes, and answer emails, then texts. And do that 3 or 4 times. In a split household, where maybe the dad has kids and then the mom too, they both are pretty much guaranteed to have to buy 2 accounts or more if they want anything. 1/5",1

They are constantly making us sign back in, they keep raising prices, and they are always asking or better yet forcing you to answer more and more personal questions so they can take and sell (leak) your information. How does a company who keeps asking for more info always have security issues? 0/10 do not get!",1

My mom pays extra for multiple screens. I'm going to tell her she should cancel her subscription because this is stupid and I hope Netflix loses money for this stupidity. All you want to do is squeeze more money out of people and I hope it backfires and they lose even more. I'm sure they'll just use it as an excuse to screw theirworker,1

It happens only when you staft playing a video. While scrolling you can reduce as much brightness as you want but in video playback it stays between 10% to 100% Kindly fix this brightness issue its very awful . I can't use it at night time with too much brightness,1

They try and force you to watch their movies And shows by taking the more popular Anime And got rid of english dub Hoping we would tolerate their versions. I stopped watching their shows when they went to A.I script writers. It's horrible story lines that focuses on colors sounds To stimulate chemical reaction in the brain. Essentially treating their audience like toddlers. Their practice is highly insulting..,1

You are stealing money from people by not providing the services we are paying you for. You are forcing people to sacrifice a service they are paying you extra for. It's bad business and a scam. Your service is not worth the same as before yet you seem to think it is. You are making it harder for us to enjoy the service we pay you for. You should make it cheaper because you took away half of the services,2
