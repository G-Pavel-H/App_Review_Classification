dca0f323-28aa-4002-8515-d0e9c3ec0eab,I love Skype until I try to add Skype credit. It goes through the Google play store and then is canceled several times until finally it goes through my bank. I've been waiting several days and still do not have Skype credit. It's ridiculous. And there is absolutely no customer support from the Google play store side!,2

5431e12c-c42d-4570-8700-5e187b66d3fc,App sometimes shows *nothing* in the call logs. The most common time it won't show your call logs? When you've missed a call. That's not dropping the ball; that's slamming it in your grandmothers grave. Call quality is mostly okay; the amount of issues is equal to that of regular carriers: maybe a dropped call or bad connection once every month or two. Edit: it no longer shows a call log; ever.,1

Other competitive apps such as WhatsApp, line and Viber all work much more reliably, better and more intuitively, with standardized locations for menus and options unlike Skype. the worst part about the Skype app is it is extremely slow and heavy (high CPU and big app size).

Also when I swipe to other apps sometimes when I come by Skype will only be using half my screen with no option to change. It's frustrating.

Chat feature is little average. Its interface is not attractive. Sometimes audio calls and video calls are like a hell when the voice breaks while communicating with each other.,4

We cannot understand something if we have not experienced it. It means how can we know a wrong or right if we only speak or listen.

I tried calling Saudi Arabia where the call charges was Rs.7.5 and just a day after its RS 8.17. The charges were deducted even without being connected. It's sheer unethical business I won't support Skype..,2

d331b83c-87a8-4cef-bf78-b589cd2bc7ee,(Fixed now) On my phone it does not show that someone has called or left a message so I sometimes don't return calls for hours. Messenger pops up an image of the caller under the same conditions. I love that you can edit/delete messages. I don't like that you can't select multiple photos to send at once. --- Right now it won't let me log in on Samsung A12 (Android) with latest OS update,4

One plus Nord N10 isn't exactly old or weird. Will be considering other apps shortly.,2
