However Dropbox also costs more than their competitors by 2-3x. Their system even on their highest level of subscription which costs over $1k/year for 3 minimum users advertise unlimited storage and bandwidth but in practice cannot come close to keeping up with automated data transfer which AWS and GCP can. Even GDrive is much faster,3

efc938c2-5816-407b-87f0-675c43e7a677,Initial review: solid mobile client for my purposes. Works well with backing up selected folders on my mobile devices (though it was unclear at first since i had to save new files in order for dropbox to discover other folders and display the option to select which folders to back up) and accessing cloud stored files to upload in other apps. Would be a big improvement to support search when uploading a file to another app and browsing dropbox for files to upload (only works directly in-app),4
08d41610-5cff-451b-81ea-628bb051143a,All I want to do is get into my Dropbox and delete a lot of pictures but no matter what I do it won't let me. It's trying to force me to upgrade but I don't want too. The Dropbox should allow you to pick what you want to save. Not save every pic you take.,1

2a181cde-928f-4dff-953a-4b5109cd37dd,"I used Dropbox for years to keep my files safe and to be able to recover them in case anything happened. In the end, it turned out that Dropbox was the worst thing that could have happened. In recent years, they released this online-only feature which makes sure only your most recently used files remain in your hard drive. The other files become online-only which means you see a placeholder on your device and when you try to open it the file gets downloaded first and only then opens. The idea in itself is genius and seemed to work pretty well at first. Eventually, I found out that when copying online-only files from one place to another those files would be copied as 0-byte files without any reference to the original file. I also found out that when uploading online-only files to a website on my browser they get uploaded as 0 bytes instead of the original. This also means that if you move a folder that contains some online-only files those files will be lost because they have no reference to the original and will be uploaded to Dropbox as 0-byte files. At some point, the situation I described above happened to me. I moved a folder from one place to another and a few minutes later decided to revert by moving it back. When I moved the folder my online-only files were moved and upload as 0-byte files and when I reverted my action it didn't matter anymore because they were already just a bunch of 0-byte files on my device and also on the cloud. I only found out a few months later that this happened. Now Dropbox claims that this wasn't their fault. They told me that they simply listen to path changes and upload whatever changes on the Dropbox folder on my device. It isn't their fault that I don't understand how online-only files work and that I didn't make sure they were all downloaded locally first. They refuse to take any responsibility while I lost some of the most important files I ever had. It is extremely upsetting that I have been paying them to keep my files safe and now they simply refuse to recognize that their feature might not be as intuitive as they thought. Even worse is that they claim to no longer have any backups of those files that were lost. Therefore, I have no way of recovering them. Based on this experience I seriously recommend that you stay away from this company if you want to keep your files safe.",1

I use Dropbox to share music with collaborators - I'd prefer not to, but they want to use Dropbox. The latest upgrade now has an embedded player, and it's now easier to share files - so finally after years of the Dropbox app telling me there was no way to open an MP3 file, now there is - but the player can't be backgrounded - how utterly annoying. You need to keep the screen alive to listen to the MP3. There is an option to open the file in Youtube Music - with apparently the option to 'always use this app' - but typical Dropbox, that doesn't work. I'm really unimpressed, this would seem like an obvious feature, you basically can't use your phone for anything else while you are listening to a sound file. Lame. Really lame.

They offer no refunds, even if the service malfunctions. (they won't even pro-rate your remaining months on a personal/family plan if you switch to business). You can't upgrade from a family plan to a business plan without the whole system crashing. it's a known issue. I notice they have taken away the ability to leave reviews on FB..... In a nutshell - I upgrade - the system breaks. I use chat support - they send me to email I use email support - they send me to the website I click the website link... THERE IS NOTHING THERE. They did kindly respond to let me know there would be no refunds though. Cheers Dropbox - Faithful customer for a decade + gone.",1

I installed it on my new (secondhand Android) phone and installed it on my w7 notebook, and it works like a charm!
